When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

DLP, as well as syncing work between geographcially separated teams.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else updates master while you are working on a feature it might bork you.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones on github that separate your project from the original.  You can copy someone's work without messing up the original project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on merging commits to the local branch to keep things simple.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You would have to manually compare files, and probably work on everything as a team and plan changes together.
