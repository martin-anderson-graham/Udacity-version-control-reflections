When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

DLP, as well as syncing work between geographcially separated teams.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else updates master while you are working on a feature it might bork you.
